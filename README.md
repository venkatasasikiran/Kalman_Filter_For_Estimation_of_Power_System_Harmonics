# Kalman_Filter_For_Estimation_of_Power_System_Harmonics

Kalman Filtering course, taken in my masters, introduced me to the Kalman filtering algorithm and its applications. To demonstrate the understanding of the Kalman filtering algorithm, I replicated the results of the IEEE paper 'Application of Kalman filtering for continuous real-time tracking of power system harmonicsâ€™ by V.M. Moreno Saiz and J. Barros Guadalupe. I analyzed the filtering algorithm dependence on various elements such as the state-space model, sudden variation, sampling frequency.

The Kalman filtering algorithm showcased that the state estimation is independent of the state-space model as long as the model accurately abstracts the behavior of the system. The algorithm also seemed to react reasonably quickly to the sudden variations in the levels of the harmonics.
